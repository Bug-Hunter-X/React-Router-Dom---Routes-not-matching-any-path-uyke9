This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in React Router Dom v6 where routes fail to match even simple paths.  The problem arises from incorrect usage of the `Routes` and `Route` components, particularly when dealing with nested routing or when there's a conflict between the base path and other routes.  The solution showcases how to correctly configure routes to ensure that they match intended paths and render the appropriate components.
